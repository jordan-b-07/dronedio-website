                        <p>DeomX1 is a fully autonomous quadcopter developed by Drone Dio for the SUAS 2025 competition. The system is designed to perform complex aerial missions with high reliability, precision, and autonomy. With a strong focus on waypoint navigation, real-time object detection, and payload delivery, DeomX1 is engineered for full mission compliance using a modular, field-adaptable architecture.</p>
                        
                        <img src="images/deomx1_side.png" alt="DeomX1 3D Model Side View">
                        <p>At the heart of DeomX1 lies the NVIDIA Jetson Orin 16GB, which executes YOLOv5-based object detection pipelines in real-time. The Orin coordinates directly with the SpeedyBee F405 V4 flight controller, ensuring smooth integration between high-level autonomy and low-level control logic.</p>
                        
                        <p>The aircraft features a 3D-printed modular payload system, capable of accurate beacon drops with minimal mechanical complexity. A lightweight carbon fibre frame was chosen for its rigidity, weight efficiency, and structural integrity. Communication is achieved through a secure 4G LTE VPN link, allowing real-time video and telemetry streaming to the ground control station.</p>
                        
                        <img src="images/deomx1_real.jpg" alt="DeomX1 Real Drone">
                        <h3>Tested and Proven</h3>
                        <p>DeomX1 has undergone extensive testing across three levels: component validation, subsystem integration, and full mission simulation. It has demonstrated consistent performance across waypoint execution, object detection, and controlled payload deployment — all within SUAS specification limits.</p>
                        
                        <p>This system represents Drone Dio's commitment to innovation, safety, and mission-readiness.</p>

                        <p>Welcome to our visual documentation of the SUAS 2025 preparation journey! Through these photographs, we'll take you behind the scenes of our technical development process, showcasing the dedication and expertise of our team members.</p>
                        
                        <img src="images/photo_blog_1.jpg" alt="Power Distribution Board Testing">
                        <p>Our journey begins with critical power system testing. Here, we're rigorously testing our Power Distribution Board (PDB) alongside our new motor and ESC combinations. This phase is crucial for ensuring optimal power delivery and motor performance throughout the mission.</p>
                        
                        <img src="images/photo_blog_2.jpg" alt="Frame Manufacturing">
                        <p>Moving to the UOW Smart building workshop, our team is manufacturing the custom frame for our drone. This facility provides us with the necessary tools and space to create precise, lightweight components that meet our exacting specifications.</p>
                        
                        <img src="images/photo_blog_3.jpg" alt="Object Detection Training">
                        <p>In our software development lab, team members are hard at work training our object detection and classification models. This crucial step ensures our drone can accurately identify and interact with mission-critical objects during the competition.</p>
                        
                        <img src="images/photo_blog_4.jpg" alt="Electronics Assembly">
                        <p>Our electronics and telecommunications specialist demonstrates their expertise in precise soldering work. These delicate operations are essential for creating reliable electrical connections that will withstand the rigors of flight.</p>
                        
                        <img src="images/photo_blog_5.jpg" alt="Payload System Integration">
                        <p>The integration phase shows our team carefully installing the payload delivery system and battery into the drone. This step requires careful attention to weight distribution and structural integrity to ensure optimal flight performance.</p>
                        
                        <img src="images/photo_blog_6.jpg" alt="Sensor Calibration">
                        <p>Finally, we see the critical process of sensor calibration. This meticulous work ensures that our drone's various sensors are perfectly aligned and calibrated, providing accurate data for navigation and control systems.</p>
                        
                        <p>Each of these steps represents a crucial milestone in our journey toward SUAS 2025. Through careful planning, technical expertise, and dedicated teamwork, we're building a drone that we believe will excel in the competition. Stay tuned for more updates as we continue our preparation!</p>
